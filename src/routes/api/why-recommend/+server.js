Provide a professional and persuasive explanation. Remember that you should talk more about [Author B's Name]. The most important aspect is their papers. Never use specific numbers of citation counts or numbers of publications. Use evidence and all based on the information given to you. Never use "Author A" or "Author B" or "your" in your response.

Be specific and professional. Always use specific reasons and evidence. Be concise but powerful.
